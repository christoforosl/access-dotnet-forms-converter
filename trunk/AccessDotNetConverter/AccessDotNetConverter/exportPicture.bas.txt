I am using MS Access automation from VB.NET to write an application that converts MS Access Forms to .NET Forms.  The code for the project is here: http://code.google.com/p/access-dotnet-forms-converter/

I am stuck with exporting the images out of MS Access Image and Command Button controls.
I have tried the approach of Ms Access **syscmd(712, NameOfControl)** to get an ole picture from PictureData property, and then use AxHost.GetPictureFromIPicture.  
The problem with this approach is the call to syscmd(712) from vb.net.  No matter what combination I use to call syscmd 712, access issues error "You made an illegal function call."

For example:

In the below code "accAppl" is an object reference to an Access.Application object and 
"control" is an object reference to an Access.Image control  

    Dim o As stdole.IPictureDisp = accAppl.SysCmd(712, control.Name) <-- FAILS

    Dim o As stdole.IPictureDisp = accAppl.SysCmd(712, control) <-- FAILS

    Dim o As stdole.IPictureDisp = accAppl.SysCmd(712, accAppl.Forms("formname").Controls("controlname") <-- FAILS


Note that the same above code called from an access vba module works without a problem.
