# The Configuration File #
The project Configuration File controls the conversion process.
Among other things, it controls the Form that all converted forms will inherit (default: "System.Windows.Forms.Form"), the classes that handle conversion of MS Access controls to .Net controls, the "root" control that will receive converted controls in .NET, etc.
